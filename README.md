# RL Assignment based on Gym Frozen Lake Environment
This assignment implements various RL Algorithms as a learning assignemnt and utilises them in the Frozen Lake Environment in the OpenAI Gym Toolkit. 
## Algorithms Implemented

1. Value Iteration
2. Policy Iteration
3. SARSA
4. Q-Learning

We also visualise the performance of &epsilon;-greedy algorithms compared to greedy algorithms, to visualise the benefits of exploration and exploitation in RL algorithms.
